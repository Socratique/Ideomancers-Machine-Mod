/**
 * A SlabBlock variant that participates in sympathetic movement.
 * The sympathetic channel is set at construction and determines which
 * other sympathetic blocks this slab will link with at range.
 *
 * isStickyBlock() returns true so vanilla's resolver calls addBranchingBlocks,
 * which triggers the sympathetic search mixin. canStickTo() answers as the full Oddstone blocks do:
 * it grabs slime, honey and Odd Slime, and links to other Oddstone only through
 * sympathetic movement.
